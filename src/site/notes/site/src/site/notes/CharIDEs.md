This is a Sprint event (under 24hrs)

What:
Build a project to a state you'd consider complete enough to have a clear picture of whether somebody built something sufficiently similar
BUT
record your screen the whole time while you do it

Then:

We feed the recording/transcript into GPT-V as reference material, then, based solely on chatting with the chatbot, participants attempt to build the same project from scratch. (Optionally, build the same project and add 1 new feature.)

JUDGING CRITERIA:
- how close to the source project is the project you built?
- does your project pass the source project's test suite?
- how cool is the feature you added?
- did you fix something that was broken in the original project?

WINNERS:
Okay this section has been the same so far for every event lol
